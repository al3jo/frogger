Frogger: HTML5 version
===============================

Frogger is a simple game, in which the player tries to cross a map avoiding collisions with the enemies.

Enemies are randomly placed at the beginning (left) of the map at different positions and they move from left to right.
The player can move up and down, left and right with the keyboard arrows.

Once the player gets to the last row, right before the water, the player advances to the next level.
If any of the enemies collides with the player, then the game is over. Also, if the player touches the water the game is
over.

If the player gets to the last row and stays there for a few seconds, then the game will reset and the player will
advance to the next level.

There are a total of 5 levels. Each level will have faster enemies.

To play the game, open the file 'index.html' in any browser, and then just move the arrows to get started.
