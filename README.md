Frogger: HTML5 version
===============================

Frogger is a simple game, in which the player tries to cross a map avoiding collisions with the enemies.

Enemies are randomly placed at the beginning (left) of the map at different positions and they move from left to right.
The player can move up and down, left and right with the keyboard arrows.

Once the player gets to the last row, right before the water, the player wins the game, and the game restarts.
If any of the enemies collides with the player before the player reaches the last row, then the player lost, the game is
over and is restarted.

To play the game, open the file 'index.html' in any browser, and then just move the arrows to get started.
